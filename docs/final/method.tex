\section{Method}
To meet the project objective, an algorithm that deploys 
facilities to meet demand for any commodity while 
minimizing oversupply was developed. 
The \texttt{Institution} agent accepts input variables that instructs
the algorithm. 

\subsection{Input Variables}
Explain the notion of demand and supply driven deployment 
and all the specific input variables. 

\subsection{Algorithm Flow}
Describe how the algorithm flows in terms of deploy solver function, 
check constraint etc. 

\subsection{Prediction Methods}
At each time step, the demand and supply for each commodity is 
predicted for the following time step. 
Based on the prediction, \deploy deploys facilities to meet the 
predicted demand. 
The demand and supply predictions are governed by four types
of algorithms: non-optimizing, time series forecasting, 
deterministic optimizing and machine learning. 
The choice of which prediction algorithm to use is a user input. 

\subsubsection{Non-Optimizing}

\subsubsection{Time Series Forecasting}

\subsubsection{Deterministic Optimizing}
