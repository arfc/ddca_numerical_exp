\section{Introduction}
For many fuel cycle simulations, it is currently up to the user to define
a deploy scheme, or facility parameters, to make sure that there's no gap
in the supply chain. Or, the same goal is achieved by setting the
\texttt{facility} capacity to infinity, which does not reflect real-world
conditions. 

The Demand-Driven Cycamore Archetype project (NEUP-FY16-10512) aims to develop \Cycamore demand-driven deployment capabilities.
The developed algorithm, in the form of \Cyclus \texttt{Institution}
agent, deploys \texttt{facilities} to meet the front-end and back-end demand of the 
fuel cycle.

This report provides numerical tests for non-optimizing, deterministic-optimizing and stochastic-optimizing prediction algorithms.

These prediction models are being developed by the University of South Carolina. 
In this report, we discuss numerical experiments for testing the non-optimizing, 
deterministic optimizing and stochastic optimizing methods. The numerical 
experiments will be designed for both the once through nuclear fuel 
cycle and advanced fuel cycles. 


\section{Method}
This report lists necessary capabilities of the new \Cyclus \texttt{institute}
for demand-driven deployment of fuel cycle facilities. 
Then the report lists tests to check correct implementation of the capabilities,
with a sample fuel cycle with well-defined facility parameters.


\section{Configuration}
The user defines prototypes to be deployed for fuel facilities,
and reactor deployment scheme.  The reactor deployment causes the demand of fuel
which triggers fuel facility deployment. The detailed input file XML input schema
is shown in Appendix A. 


\section{Algorithm Flow}

The algorithm, upon entering, creates a supply chain with the fuel facilities and
the reactor. Then, at every timestep it calculates the expected demand from each fuel cycle
facility and makes decisions to deploy or decommission. As a reference, the time step
execution for \Cyclus is illustrated in figure \ref{diag:time}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance=1.5cm]
\node (Build) [process] {Build (kernel)};
\node (Tick) [process, below of=Build] {Tick (agent)};
\node (DRE) [process, below of=Tick]{Dynamic Resource Exchange (kernel) };
\node (Tock) [process, below of=DRE]{Tock (agent)};
\node (Decom) [process, below of=Tock] {Decommission (kernel)};

\draw [arrow] (Build) -- (Tick); 
\draw [arrow] (Tick) -- (DRE);
\draw [arrow] (DRE) -- (Tock);
\draw [arrow] (Tock) -- (Decom);
\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Each timestep in \Cyclus follows the five steps in order. Processes labeled
         kernel are executed by the \Cyclus framework, whereas processes labeled agent
         are executed by individual agents. What happens in the `Tick' and `Tock' is
         thus unique to each archetype.}
\label{diag:time}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Upon Entering (\texttt{Enternotify})}

The algorithm creates a supply chain with the fuel facilities,
then calculates the demand for each facility for a unit quantity of fuel
(example in figure \ref{diag:dem}). It also orders to build fuel cycle
facilities for the reactors at timestep 1.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance=4.7cm]
\node (source) [process] {\texttt{Source} [$ax$]};
\node (enrichment) [process, right of=source] {\texttt{Enrichment} [$x$]};
\node (reactor) [process, right of=enrichment]{\texttt{Reactor} [$x$]};
\node (sink) [process, right of=reactor]{\texttt{Sink} [$x$]};

\draw [arrow] (source) -- (enrichment); 
\draw [arrow] (enrichment) -- (reactor);
\draw [arrow] (reactor) -- (sink);
\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Simple demand flow of materials. The values in the bracket are demands calculated
         by the algorithm. The \texttt{Reactor} demands $x$ amount of fuel,
         which translates into demands of $x$ from \texttt{Enrichment} and \texttt{Sink}.
         The \texttt{Source} has a demand of $a x$ to take in for enrichment losses.
         $a \approx 9 $ for 3\% enrichment.}
\label{diag:dem}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Tick}
The algorithm calculates the fuel demand
from the fleet of reactors at one timestep ahead, and the corresponding demand for fuel facilities.
The current capacity of each fuel cycle facility is also calculated. If the capacity
is smaller than the demand, the algorithm orders to build more facilities to meet the demand,
so that the fuel demand is met for the next timestep.

\section{Simulation parameter for Test Scenarios}
Simple parameters are given to fuel cycle facilities for the numerical test of 
the algorithm.  
table \ref{tab:reactor} provides the parameters for the \texttt{reactors} in the test scenarios and table \ref{tab:everythingelse} provides the parameters for the \texttt{source}, \texttt{enrichment} and \texttt{sink} facilities in the test scenarios.

\section{Numerical Tests for the Non-optimizing prediction method}
To ensure that the non-optimizing prediction model is working correctly, each function of the code must be tested to determine if its output matches the analytical solution for the specified test scenario. In this section, the tests that must be met is described based on the parameters defined in table \ref{tab:reactor} and \ref{tab:everythingelse} and analytical solution of a defined simple scenario. Unit test examples are included in Appendix B.
\\
\\
\noindent
\textbf{Test 1: A reactor outputs the user defined power capacity when deployed and does not output
power capacity when decommissioned.} \\
Test Scenario: A single reactor is deployed at time step 2 and decommissioned at time step 4. There is an infinite source of fuel for the reactor. \\
Analytical Solution: During cycle time, the reactor will have a power output of 1000MWe. Therefore,
there is only be power output of 1000MWe at time steps 2 and 3. The analytical solution of
the power output of the reactor per time step is given in table \ref{tab:test-power}.

\begin{table}[H]

\noindent
\textbf{Test 2: A reactor outputs the user defined power capacity during its cycle time and not during its refuel time.} \\
Test Scenario: A single reactor is deployed at time step 2 and decommissioned at time step 87 \\
Analytical Solution: Based on the reactor parameters defined in table 1, the reactor will have a cycle time of 2 time steps and a refuel time of 1 time step. Therefore, there is only be power output of 1000MWe during cycle time steps. The analytical solution of the power output of the reactor per time step is given in table \ref{tab:test-cycles}.

\begin{table}[H]

\noindent
\textbf{Test 3: A facility that produces reactor’s input commodity (fuel) is deployed when the amount of fuel available is below the amount of fuel required by the reactor.} \\
Test Scenario: A single reactor is deployed at time step 2.\\
Analytical Solution: Based on the simple supply chain example in figure \ref{diag:dem} and enrichment facility parameters defined in table \ref{tab:everythingelse}, an enrichment facility must be deployed at time step 2 to meet fuel demand. The analytical solution of the enrichment facility deployment per time step is given in table \ref{tab:test-fuel}.

    \end{tabularx}
    \caption {Analytical solution of the number of fuel facilities deployed per time step}
    \label{tab:test-fuel}
\end{table}

\noindent
\textbf{Test 4: An appropriate number of facilities that produces reactor's input commodity (fuel) is deployed to meet the demand of the amount of fuel required by the reactor, when the initial fuel supply is non-zero.} \\
Test Scenario: An initial fuel supply of 100kg. 2 reactors deployed at time step 2. \\
Analytical solution: Based on table \ref{tab:reactor}, each reactor has a fuel demand of 300kg per time step. Therefore, the fuel supply is 100kg at time step 1 and is 700kg at time steps 2 and 3. The analytical solution of fuel quantity per time step is given in table \ref{tab:test-fueldemand}  

\begin{table}[H]

\noindent
\textbf{Test 5: The fuel supply is within plus-minus the output of 1 fuel-producing facility of the reactor demand for fuel for all time steps.} \\
Test Scenario: A reactor is deployed at timesteps 2, 3 and 4.\\
Analytical Solution: Based on table \ref{tab:reactor}, each reactor has a fuel demand of 300kg per time step. If an appropriate number of enrichment facilities is deployed to meet fuel demand, the difference between fuel quantity and fuel demand will be 100kg per time step. The analytical solution of difference between fuel quantity and fuel demand per time step is given in table \ref{tab:test-fueldiff}.  

\begin{table}[H]

\noindent
\textbf{Test 6: A fuel-producing facility is decommissioned when the amount of fuel available exceeds the the amount of fuel required by the reactor by 1 fuel-producing facility's fuel output for the number of user-defined consecutive time steps.} \\
Test Scenario: An enrichment facility is deployed at time step 2. \\
Analytical Solution: Based on table \ref{tab:everythingelse}, the supply of fuel must exceed demand by 1 enrichment facility output for 3 consecutive time steps before it is decommissioned. Therefore, the enrichment facility must be decommissioned at time step 5. The analytical solution of the enrichment facility deployment per time step is given in table \ref{tab:test-supplymoredemand}.

Test Scenario: An enrichment facility is deployed at time step 2. \\
Analytical Solution: Based on the simple supply chain example in
figure \ref{diag:dem}, a source facility must be deployed at time step 2 to meet natural uranium demand. The analytical solution of the source facility deployment per time step is given in table \ref{tab:test-NUdemand}.

\noindent
\textbf{Test 8: An appropriate number of facilities that produces fuel-producing facility's input commodity is deployed to meet the demand of input commodity required by the fuel producing facility, when the initial input commodity is non-zero.} \\
Test Scenario: An initial natural uranium supply of 1000kg. 1 enrichment facility deployed at time step 2. \\
Analytical solution: Based on table \ref{tab:everythingelse}, each enrichment facility has a SWU capacity of 2000 SWU per time step and each source facility has a throughput of 3000kg per time step. Based on table \ref{tab:simulationparameters}, approximately 3500kg of natural uranium is required for enrichment SWU capacity of 2000. Therefore, 1 source facility must be commissioned to meet the demand of one enrichment facility. Therefore, the natural uranium supply is 1000kg at time step 1 and is 4500kg at time steps 2 and 3. The analytical solution of fuel quantity per time step is given in table \ref{tab:test-NUdemand2}.

Test Scenario: An enrichment facility is deployed at timesteps 2, 3 and 4.\\
Analytical Solution: Based on table \ref{tab:simulationparameters}, each enrichment facility has a natural uranium demand of 3412kg per time step. If an appropriate number of source facilities is deployed to meet natural uranium demand, the difference between fuel quantity and fuel demand will be 88kg per time step. The analytical solution of difference between natural uranium quantity and natural uranium demand per time step is given in table \ref{tab:test-NUdiff}.

Analytical Solution: Based on table \ref{tab:everythingelse}, the supply of natural uranium must exceed demand by 1 source facility output for 3 consecutive time steps before it is decommissioned.

First, the user defines the prototypes to be deployed
to support the reactor.

\begin{code}

\begin{minted}[bgcolor=bg]{xml}
<interleave>
  <element name="institution">
    <data type="string"/>
