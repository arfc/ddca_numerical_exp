	abstract = {As nuclear power expands, technical, economic, political, and environmental analyses of nuclear fuel cycles by simulators increase in importance. To date, however, current tools are often fleet-based rather than discrete and restrictively licensed rather than open source. Each of these choices presents a challenge to modeling fidelity, generality, efficiency, robustness, and scientific transparency. The Cyclus nuclear fuel cycle simulator framework and its modeling ecosystem incorporate modern insights from simulation science and software architecture to solve these problems so that challenges in nuclear fuel cycle analysis can be better addressed. A summary of the Cyclus fuel cycle simulator framework and its modeling ecosystem are presented. Additionally, the implementation of each is discussed in the context of motivating challenges in nuclear fuel cycle simulation. Finally, the current capabilities of Cyclus are demonstrated for both open and closed fuel cycles.},

	abstract = {This study has identiﬁed ﬂexible, general, and performant algorithms available for application to simulating demand-driven deployment of nuclear fuel cycle facility capacity in a fuel cycle simulator. Accordingly, a review of current Nuclear Fuel Cycle (NFC) simulation tools was conducted to determine their current capabilities for demand-driven and transition scenarios. Additionally, the authors investigated promising algorithmic innovations that have been successful for similar applications in other domains such as economics and industrial engineering Finally, the applicability of such algorithms in the context of challenging nuclear fuel cycle simulation questions has been described.},
