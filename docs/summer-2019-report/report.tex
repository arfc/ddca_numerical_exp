\section{Introduction}
\gls{NFC} simulation scenarios are constrained objective functions. 
The objectives are systemic demands such as "1\% power growth", 
while an example of a constraint is the availability of new nuclear 
technology. 
To add ease in setting up nuclear fuel cycle simulations, \gls{NFC}
simulators should bring demand responsive deployment decisions into 
the dynamics of the simulation logic \cite{huff_current_2017}. 
While automated power production deployment is common in most fuel 
cycle simulators, automated deployment of supportive fuel cycle 
facilities is non-existent. 

Instead, the user must detail the deployment timeline of all 
supporting facilities or have infinite capacity support facilities. 
Thus, a next generation \gls{NFC} simulator should predictively and 
automatically deploy fuel cycle facilities to meet user defined 
power demand. 

\Cyclus is an agent-based nuclear fuel cycle simulation framework 
\cite{huff_fundamental_2016}. 
Each entity (i.e. Region, Institution, or Facility) in the fuel 
cycle is modeled as an agent. 
Institution agents
are responsible for deploying and decommissioning facility agents 
and can represent a legal operating organization such as a 
utility, government, etc \cite{huff_fundamental_2016}. 

The Demand-Driven \Cycamore Archetypes project (NEUP-FY16-10512)
aims to develop \Cyclus's demand-driven deployment capabilities. 
This capability is developed in the form of a \Cyclus Institution
agent that deploys facilities to meet the front-end and back-end 
fuel cycle demands based on a user-defined commodity demand. 
Its goal is to meet supply for any commodity while minimizing 
undersupply.
This demand-driven deployment capability is referred to as 
\deploy. 

In this paper, we will explain the capabilities of \deploy, 
demonstrate how \deploy is used to meet the primary objective
of minimizing undersupply of all commodities in a simulation.
The goal is to study a basic transition scenarios with constant,
linearly increasing and sinusoidal power demand. Such study
provides recommendations and insights to inform 
decisions about parameter inputs when setting up 
larger transition scenarios that include many facilities.
The last cases analyzed are such transition scenarios.

\section{D3ploy capabilities}
\subsection{\textbf{Core Capability of \deploy}}
At each time step, \deploy predicts demand and supply of each 
commodity for the next time step.
Then, \deploy deploys facilities to meet predicted demand. 
\Deploy's primary objective is to minimize the number of time 
steps of undersupply of any commodity. 

When there is a predicted undersupply of a commodity, \deploy looks 
at what facilities it has that provides that commodity and 
will deploy the fewest number of facilities
to meet the predicted demand. 
This logic is available in \texttt{solver.py}. 

\subsection{\textbf{Basic User-Defined Input Variables}}
The user is able to input specific variables to customize their
simulation. 
Descriptions of each input variable can be found in the 
README of the \deploy github repository.

Essentially, the user must define the facilities for the 
institution to control and their corresponding capacities. 
The user must also define the driving commodity, its demand 
equation and what calculation method the institution predicts 
demand and supply with. 

They also have the option to give a time dependent equation that governs
preference for that facility compared to other facilities that 
provide the same commodity. 
The user also has an option to constrain deployment of a facility 
until there is a accumulation of the inventory of a specific commodity.  
The user can also define an initial list of facilities that 
are present in the institution at the beginning of the simulation. 

\subsection{\textbf{Prediction Algorithms}}
Three interchangeable algorithm types govern demand and supply 
predictions: non-optimizing (NO), deterministic optimizing (DO), and stochastic
optimizing (SO). 

There are three methods implemented for the non-optimizing model: 
Moving Average (MA), autoregressive moving average (ARMA), and autoregressive 
conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH).
There are four methods implemented for the deterministic optimizing model: 
Polynomial fit regression (POLY), simple exponential smoothing (EXP\_SMOOTHING),  
triple exponential smoothing (HOLT\_WINTERS) and fast fourier 
transform (FFT). 
There is one method implemented for stochastic optimizing model: 
stepwise seasonal (SW\_SEASONAL).  

The user can choose which prediction algorithm governs each specific 
\deploy commodity. 
The effectiveness of a prediction algorithm depends on the type 
of power demand in a scenario and the type of commodity. 
For example, the triple exponential smoothing method is most effective
for predicting demand and supply for the power commodity in a scenario  
with a sinusoidal power demand compared to a linearly increasing power 
demand.
Whereas, the fast fourier transform method is more effective than triple 
exponential smoothing for the non-power commodities in the same 
scenario.  

\subsection{\textbf{Difference between Demand and Supply Driven Institutions}}
Within \deploy, there are two institutions: \texttt{DemandDrivenDeploymentInst} and \texttt{SupplyDrivenDeploymentInst}. 
The prior is used for the front-end of the fuel cycle and the latter is used 
for the back-end. 
Front-end facilities are those that exist before the reactor 
in a nuclear fuel cycle such as a fuel fabrication facility. 
Back-end facilities go after the reactor in a nuclear 
fuel cycle such as a reprocessing facility. 
The reason for this separation is to let facilities have the choice 
to demand for supply or demand for capacity. 
For example, in the front-end facilities, the reactor has a demand for 
fuel that triggers the deployment of fuel fabrication facilities. Such facilities
will create a supply to meet the demand.
Whereas, for the back end facilities, the reactor generates spent fuel, 
there is a demand for a waste repository facility to accept the 
spent fuel. This triggers the deployment of a waste repository that
will create a capacity to receive the available supply of spent fuel.

\subsection{\textbf{Installed Capacity}}
The user can choose between deploying facilities based on the difference 
between predicted demand and predicted supply or predicted demand and 
installed capacity. 
There are two reasons for wanting to use installed capacity over predicted 
supply. 
The first is for facilities that provide intermittent supply, such as a 
reactor facility that has a designated refueling time. 
During time steps where a reactor is refueling, the user might not 
want \deploy to deploy more facilities to make up for the lack of supply
caused by this one time step gap in supply. 
The second is for situations where the input commodity for a facility has
run out in a simulation and the facility that produces the input commodity 
is no longer commissionable. 
Therefore, with the demand for the output commodity of that facility, \deploy
would deploy that facility to meet the demand, however due to the lack of 
the input commodity, even if there are infinite numbers of that facility, 
it will not produce the output commodity. 
For example, in a transition scenario to fast reactors that require plutonium 
from \gls{LWR}'s \gls{SNF}, if the fast reactor's demand for plutonium exceeds
the inventory provided by \gls{LWR}s before they were decommissioned, it will 
result in the deployment of mixer facilities that generate the fast reactor 
fuel despite the lack of plutonium to generate the fuel. 
This is an example of a poorly set up transition scenario. 

\subsection{\textbf{Supply/Capacity Buffer}}
In \texttt{DemandDrivenDeploymentInst}, the user can choose to provide a
buffer for the predicted supply so that \deploy will ensure that 
the predicted supply will meet the predicted demand with the 
additional buffer. 

In \texttt{SupplyDrivenDeploymentInst}, the user can choose to 
provide a buffer for the predicted capacity so that \deploy will 
ensure predicted capacity meets the predicted supply with the 
additional buffer. 
The buffer can be defined as a percentage value or an absolute value.  

\section{Demonstration of d3ploy capabilities}
To demonstrate \deploy's capabilities we run simulations with
constant, linearly increasing, and sinusoidal power demand.
A balance between the various system parameters must be 
met for each type of simulation to minimize the undersupply
and under capacity for the various commodities. 

These simulations were basic transition scenarios that only included 
three types of facilities: \texttt{source}, \texttt{reactor} and 
\texttt{sink}.
All of the simulations began with ten reactor facilities, 
\texttt{reactor1} to \texttt{reactor10}.
These reactors had staggered cycle lengths and lifetimes 
so that they did not refuel and decommission all at the same
time step.
\Deploy deploys reactor facilities of \texttt{new reactor} type
to meet the power demand that occurred when the ten initial 
reactor facilities began to decommission.

All the simulations deployed facilities based on the relationship
between predicted demand and installed capacity, capability 
discussed in the previous section.
Table \ref{tab:transition-scenario-all} shows the simulation 
parameters that are consistent across all the discussed 
scenarios. Table \ref{tab:transition-scenario-results} displays
the number of time steps where there was an undersupply for
each commodity.

\begin{table*}[htb]
    \centering
    \caption {Transition Scenario Parameters for the constant, linear increasing, and sinusoidal power demand simulations.}
	\label{tab:transition-scenario-all}
    \begin{tabular}{|l|p{4.5cm}|}
    \hline
    \textbf{Parameters}    & \textbf{Description} \\ \hline
    Facilities Present     & \texttt{Source} (Capacity: 3000kg), \texttt{Reactor} (Capacity: 1000MW), \texttt{Sink} (Capacity: 50000kg)      \\ \hline
    New Reactor Parameters & Cycle time: 18, Refuel time: 1\\ \hline
    Driving Commodity & Power \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table*}

The reason for setting up these basic transition scenarios is to 
demonstrate \deploy's capabilities for use in simulating 
transition scenarios and 
also to inform decisions about parameter inputs when setting up larger 
demand transition scenarios that include many facilities.

	\end{tabular}
\end{table*}

\subsection{Transition Scenario: Constant Demand}
This section shows a constant power transition scenario.
Table \ref{tab:transition-scenario-constant-power} displays the 
simulation parameters. The input file used to generate this
simulation can be found in:

\noindent
$/d3ploy/input/constant\_transition.xml$

\noindent
and the file used to run the simulation and generate the plots can be found in:

\noindent
$/d3ploy/tests/performance\_tests/algorithm\_performance\_tests\_transitions.py$

Figures \ref{fig:constanttransition-power}, \ref{fig:constanttransition-fuel}
and \ref{fig:constanttransition-spentfuel} demonstrate the capability 
of \deploy to deploy reactor and supporting facilities to meet the user 
determined power demand and subsequently demanded secondary commodities 
with minimal time steps where there is an undersupply. 

\begin{table*}[!htbp]
	\centering
	\caption {Constant Power Demand Transition Scenario's Parameters.}
	\label{tab:transition-scenario-constant-power}
	\begin{tabular}{|l|l|p{4.cm}|}
		\hline
		& \textbf{Parameters}    & \textbf{Description} \\ \hline
		\textbf{Overall}& Demand Equation & 10000 MW \\ \hline
		\multirow{2}{*}{\textbf{Power Commodity}} & Prediction Method      &  Fast Fourier Transform\\ \cline{2-3} 
		& Supply Buffer          &  3000 MW \\ \hline
		\multirow{2}{*}{\textbf{Fuel Commodity}}  & Prediction Method      &  Moving Average\\ \cline{2-3}
		& Supply Buffer & 0 kg \\ \hline
		\multirow{2}{*}{\textbf{Spent Fuel Commodity}}  & Prediction Method      &  Moving Average\\ \cline{2-3}
		& Capacity Buffer & 0 kg \\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{table*}

Table \ref{tab:transition-scenario-results} shows the number of time 
steps where there was an undersupply for each commodity in this scenario. 
In figure \ref{fig:constanttransition-power}, there are no time steps
where the supply of power falls under demand.

The use of the fast fourier transform method for predicting the
demand and setting the supply buffer to 3000MW (the capacity of 3 reactors)
minimized the number of undersupply time steps.

It is important to perform a small sensitivity analysis of the size 
of buffer to use for each commodity to ensure that there is no 
undersupply based on the nuances of the facility type: 
refueling in a reactor etc. 

In figure \ref{fig:constanttransition-fuel},
a facility with a large throughput of fuel is initially
deployed to meet the large initial fuel demand for the starting
up of ten reactors. 
This is a reflection of reality where reactor manufacturers will 
accumulate an appropriate amount of fuel inventory before starting 
up reactors. 
There is one time step where there is an undersupply after the 
decommissioning of the large initial facility.  
This is unavoidable as the prediction methods in \deploy are unable 
to predict this sudden drop in demand. 

For simulations where a facility requires a large amount of start up
commodity such as in this simulation, the user should add an initial
facility with a large throughput to exist for the first few time steps
in the simulation, so as to prevent \deploy from deploying a large amount
of supporting facilities that end up being redundant at the later parts of 
the simulation.
This could also be circumvented by introducing decommissioning 
capability into \deploy.

\subsection{Transition Scenario: Linearly Increasing Demand}

This section presents a transition scenario where there is a linearly 
increasing power demand. 
Table \ref{tab:transition-scenario-growing-power} displays the 
simulation parameters used in this transition scenario. 

\begin{table*}[!htbp]
	\centering
	\caption {Linearly Increasing Power Demand Transition Scenario's Parameters.}

	\begin{tabular}{|l|l|p{4.1cm}|}

		\textbf{Overall}& Demand Equation & Time$<$40: 10000 MW, Time$>$40: 250*t MW \\ \hline
		\multirow{2}{*}{\textbf{Power Commodity}} & Prediction Method      &  Fast Fourier Transform \\ \cline{2-3} 
		& Supply Buffer          &  2000 MW \\ \hline
		\multirow{2}{*}{\textbf{Fuel Commodity}}  & Prediction Method      &  Moving Average\\ \cline{2-3}
		& Supply Buffer & 1000 kg \\ \hline
		\multirow{2}{*}{\textbf{Spent Fuel Commodity}}  & Prediction Method      &  Fast Fourier Transform \\ \cline{2-3}
		& Capacity Buffer & 0 kg \\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{table*}

Figures \ref{fig:growingtransition-power}, \ref{fig:growingtransition-fuel}
and \ref{fig:growingtransition-spentfuel} demonstrate the capability 
of \deploy to deploy reactor and supporting facilities to meet the user 
determined power demand and subsequently demanded secondary commodities 
for a linearly increasing power demand. 

This scenario made use of the fast fourier transform method for predicting power
demand, similar to what the constant power demand transition scenario used.
The supply buffer for power was of 2000MW.

    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Transition Scenario: Linearly Increasing Power Demand.}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{\textbf{Transition Scenario: Sinusoidal Demand}}
This section shows a transition scenario with sinusoidal
power demand. 
A sinusoidal power demand is the reflection of power demand in 
the real world where power usage is higher in the winter and summer
and it is smaller in the spring and fall. 
Table \ref{tab:transition-scenario-sine-power} displays the 
simulation parameters used in this transition scenario. The power demand
had an amplitude of 1000MW.

Figures \ref{fig:sinetransition-power}, \ref{fig:sinetransition-fuel}
and \ref{fig:sinetransition-spentfuel} demonstrate the capability 
of \deploy to deploy reactor and supporting facilities to meet the user 
determined power demand and subsequently demanded secondary commodities 
for a sinusoidal power demand. 

For a sinusoidal power demand, the use of the triple exponential method
(holt winters)
for predicting demand is more effective than the 
fast fourier transform method which was used for the constant 
and linearly increasing power demand transition scenarios. 
This is because the triple exponential smoothing method excels in
forecasting data points for repetitive seasonal series of data.

\section{Transition Scenarios}

The objective of this section was to carry out various simulations to prove 
\texttt{D3ploy}'s current capabilities for simulating complex cycles.
The Idaho National Laboratory Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation and Screening Report \cite{wigeland_nuclear_2014} established several fuel cycle scenarios.
As part of the project NEUP-FY16-10512, the simulations focused on the cases EG01, EG23, EG24. The scenarios started at EG01 -- representing the current U.S. fuel cycle -- and transitioned to advanced fuel cycles.
The simulations utilized \texttt{d3ploy}'s NO, DO, and SO algorithms.

All the analyzed scenarios started at EG01. In EG01 all the reactors were LWR's. The cycle is once-through and feeds the reactors with enriched-U.
In EG23 Fast reactors (FR's) produced all the power. The reactors relied on the continuous recycle of U/Pu with the addition of new natural-U to the cycle.
EG24 was similar to EG23 but its cycle utilized continuous recycling of U/TRU with the addition of new natural-U.

The present work focused on two transition scenarios: EG01-EG23 and EG01-EG24, shown in Figure \ref{fig:flow}. The simulations started with a fleet of LWR's. After 80 years, the simulation decommissioned the LWR's progressively transitioning to FR's. Finally, the FR's produce all the power. The start up of the FR's relies on the reprocessed Pu from the LWR's. After the transition, the FR's are able to produce their own Pu to sustain the cycle.

The following section presents the results for EG01-EG23 and EG01-EG24. The power demand considered was a constant of 60 GW at all times. The transition scenarios used the capability of deploying facilities based on the difference between predicted demand and predicted supply. The supply buffer of power was 2000 MW. 

There is also a sensitivity analysis of the buffer size. Another sensitivity analysis shows the dependency of the undersupply on the number of previous time steps used to calculate the predicted demand and supply.

\subsection{EG01-EG23}

Figure \ref{fig:23power} shows the power demand and supply obtained using different prediction methods. Following, the tables \ref{tab:23-power} and \ref{tab:23-commod} display a comparison of the different algorithms. The table \ref{tab:23-power} has the Cumulative Undersupply and the Cumulative Oversupply magnitudes. These values represent the summation of the difference between the power supplied and the power demanded for all the time steps in the simulation.

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
This paper describes the capabilities of \deploy, demonstrates 
the use of \deploy for an assortment of transition scenarios: 
constant power demand, linearly increasing power demand and
sinusoidal power demand.  
It also provides insights on parameter inputs to ease the
setting up of larger transition scenarios that include many facilities. 
Future work includes setting up similar power demand transition 
scenarios for extended nuclear fuel cycles that incorporate reprocessing 
facilities etc. 
A more realistic transition scenario could be explored such as an 
increasing power demand that has a sinusoidal pattern to represent 
seasons in a year for a growing power demand trend. 
I am aware that Roberto is currently setting up the transition 
scenarios as a constant power demand, but the above type of scenario 
(growing sinusoidal) could be an interesting transition scenario 
to do. 
Perhaps, since the EG01-EG23 scenario is more or less completed, 
Sonata, you could look into just changing the power demand equation
to be a growing sinusoidal and see if the scenario can be adapted for 
this new power demand. 

-Decommision capability as seen during the demonstration of \deploy capabilities.
